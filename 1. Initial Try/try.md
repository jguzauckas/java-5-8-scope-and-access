# Initial Try

Here are a couple of examples of method(s) from a `Person` class. Determine if you think they would work as intended or not and write why below!

```java
// Allows changing of the `name` instance variable.
public setName(String name) {
    name = name;
}
```

Does this work? 
Why or why not?

```java
// Says hello to another person.
public void sayHi(String name) {
    System.out.println("Hi " + name + "!");
}
```

Does this work? 
Why or why not?

public void method1(int x) {
    return x * 5;
}

public voidm method2(double y) {
    return x + y;
}
```
